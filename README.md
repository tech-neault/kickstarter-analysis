# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns using Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
   Our friend Louise is currently raising money for her play. She is using Kickstarter to do so. She's curious about the success rates of other similar projects, and has asked us to look into it for her. In this analysis, we used data on Kickstarter-funded arts projects that vary in size and scope. By using this data to investigate the outcomes of projects similar to Louise's, we hope to give her an idea of what she can expect from her Kickstarter fundraising.
