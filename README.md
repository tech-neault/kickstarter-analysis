# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns using Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
   Our friend Louise is currently raising money for her play. She is using Kickstarter to do so. She's curious about the success rates of other similar projects, and has asked us to look into it for her. In this analysis, we used data on Kickstarter-funded arts projects that vary in size and scope. By using this data to investigate the outcomes of projects similar to Louise's, we hope to give her an idea of what she can expect from her Kickstarter fundraising. 
 
 ## Analysis and Challenges
    
### Analysis of Outcomes, Based on Launch Date

Based on the launch date, we can see that there are certain months where the total number of successful Kickstarters is higher. In the month of May, we can see that there were over 100 successful launches, suggesting that May is an excellent time to begin a Kickstarter campaign. However, as the summer months pass, the successful Kickstarters decline in number, while the failed Kickstarters remain relatively steady. This suggests that the later in the summer months (June through August) the Kickstarter is launched, the less likely it is to be successful. 

### Analysis of Outcomes, Based on Goals

The goals of the fundraisers fall across a wide spectrum, with some looking to raise under $1,000 and the highest seeking $100 million. With one exception, the general trend is that fundraisers with lower goals have a higher chance of successfully raising the money they seek.
